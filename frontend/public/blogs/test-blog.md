Welcome. If you are reading this, the blog rendering pipeline is most likely working.  
This post exists purely for testing purposes.

Things this post helps verify:

- Markdown rendering
- Headings and text hierarchy
- Lists and blockquotes
- Code blocks and syntax highlighting

If something looks wrong here, it will almost certainly look wrong in real posts.


## Random Placeholder Thoughts

Lorem Ipsum is useful, but sometimes it hides real issues.  
This section uses intentionally ordinary text to resemble a real post.

Common developer thoughts include:

- "This works on my machine."
- "I will clean this up later."
- "Nothing could possibly go wrong."

> A test blog post should feel slightly artificial.  
> Its purpose is validation, not storytelling.


## Sample C Code

The following program is intentionally simple. It exists only to test formatting and syntax highlighting.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  printf("Hello, test blog\n");

  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("Iteration %d\n", i);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

## Sample Bash Script

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

echo "Starting test script"

for file in *.md; do
  echo "Found markdown file: $file"
done

echo "Test script finished"
```
